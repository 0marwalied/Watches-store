# Watches Store - My First Website

This is my very first website project! I built it when I had just learned the **basics of HTML and CSS**. It’s a simple website for a watch store, and it represents my first steps in web development.

## About the Project
This website is for a fictional watch store. It includes:
- A home page with a big banner and some text.
- A section showing different types of watches.
- A basic navigation bar at the top.
- A footer with some links.

## What I Knew at the Time
- Basic **HTML** for creating the structure of a website.
- Basic **CSS** for styling (colors, fonts, spacing).
- How to add images and links to a webpage.

## How to View the Website
1. Visit the live website: [Watches Store](https://0marwalied.github.io/Watches-store/)
2. Or, download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
